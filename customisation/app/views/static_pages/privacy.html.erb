      <p>DMPTuuli</p>

      <h2 class="fontsize-h3">DMPTuuli</h2>
      <p>DMPTuuli ('the tool', 'the system', ‘the service’) is a tool developed by the Digital Curation Centre, University of Edinburgh, UK and California Digital Library as a shared resource for the research community. It is hosted at the University of Edinburgh by the DCC. The Tool is maintained as separate instance and tailored for Finnish research organisations by Tuuli Office. The data is stored at servers of EDINA, University of Edinburgh, UK.</p>

      <h2 class="fontsize-h3">Purpose for processing the personal data</h2>
      <p>The register is developed to manage information about users and data management plans created by users. The information about the users is needed to manage user accounts and give access to the DMPTuuli tool. The University of Edinburgh holds plans created by users on user's behalf, but they are user's property and responsibility.</p>
      <p>In order to help identify and administer your account with DMPTuuli, we need to store your name and email address. We may also use it to contact you to obtain feedback on your use of the tool, or to inform you of the latest developments or releases.</p>
      <p>The information user enter into this system can be seen by the User, people User have chosen to share access with, and - solely for the purposes of maintaining the service - system administrators at the University of Edinburgh and Helsinki University Library. Admistrators compile anonymised, automated and aggregated information from plans, but they will not directly access, make use of, or share content created by User with anyone else without users' permission.</p>
      <p>Authorised officers of user's home institution (Admin) may access the metadata of data management plans or user information. Metadata includes: Plan name, ID, Grant number, Principal Investigator/Researcher, Principal Investigator/Researcher ID, Plan data contact, Description, email.</p>

      <h2 class="fontsize-h3">The principles of data protection</h2>
      <p>Data transmitted along information networks are encrypted by means of SSL technology. A register generated from data of Users and data management plans for a server is thereby protected.</p>
      <p>The passwords are stored in encrypted form and cannot be retrieved. If forgotten it has to be reset.</p>

      <h2 class="fontsize-h3">Right of access by the data subject</h2>
      <p>The personal data is managed by the user (data subject). Therefore they have full access to their own personal data at any point of time. We will hold the personal data you provided us for as long as you continue using the DMPTuuli service. Your personal data can be removed from this service upon request to the DMPTuuli team within a period of 28 days.</p>

      <h2 class="fontsize-h3">Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</h2>
      <p>The personal data is managed by the user (data subject). The system administrator will manage personal data of the user only based on request from the user.</p>
